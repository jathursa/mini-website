<h3>Example queries are listed below</h3>
<ol>
<li>To find every single customers information through SQL you would have to simply type in "Select*From Customers" after that make sure you run the database.After it has been run through it will give you all the customers details.</li>
<li>If you want to find out a specific place where your customers are from you would type in"SELECT * FROM Customers Where City="London";
</li>
<li>If you want to keep a track of the customers that are living in the country by using two at the same time you would have to SELECT * FROM Customers Where Country ="UK" OR Country="Brazil"; by using this it would run the system by making sure you are looking for two diffrent types of country at the ssame time.
</li>
<li>If you want to find out a customers postcode or address by only using his/her full name you would have to simply write down SELECT Postalcode, Address From Customers Where Contactname = "Thomas Hardy"</li>
</ol>
